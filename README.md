# Development process
This repository contains scripts that help to manage and develop Knot.x project and its GitHub repositories.
Below you will find instructions on how to setup local Knot.x developer's e environment and build:
- [Knot.x Stack](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-stack) - a way of distributing a fully functional bootstrap project for Knot.x-based solutions.
- [Knot.x Docker Image](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-docker) - which is a base image for Knot.x solutions using the Docker `FROM` directive.   
- [Knot.x Starter-Kit](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit) - a template project that you can use when creating Knot.x extensions. 

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding make sure you have installed:
- Java 8
- Gradle 5+
- Maven 3.2+
- (optionally) Your favourite IDE - we will use IntelliJ for the purpose of these instructions
- (optionally) Docker installed (if you intend to build Knot.x Docker images)

If you are a Windows user, please install and configure [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL).
Scripts in that repository are designed to be used on Linux-based platforms.

## Setup developer environment
Start with cloning this repository into your workspace. Let's call it `$KNOTX`.

### Clone all Knot.x repositories
From the `$KNOTX/knotx-aggregator/development` directory run:

```bash
./pull-all.sh -r ../../ -b master
```

This will pull all Knot.x repositories into `$KNOTX` root and checkout default `master` branch.
The `-r` option specifies the directory where all Knot.x repositories are cloned (which is `$KNOTX`).
Check `./pull-all.sh -h` option for help. 

> Note:
> Execute all scripts from `knotx-aggregator/development` directory, executing them from another 
directory will fail.

### Setup IDE
> This step is optional
 
Now as you have all repositories cloned (make sure by running `ls -al` form `$KNOTX`) you may setup your IDE.
The easiest way to do it is to enter `$KNOTX/knotx-stack` and run `idea .`. 
That will spawn IntelliJ prompt window that will ask you on project import details. After a couple of minutes (importing
all modules make take some time) you should end with configured Knot.x project.

> Note:
> `knotx-stack` repository contains [Gradle composite build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) definition.
> The repository allows you to re-build all Knot.x modules and use them during integration tests, bypassing the
  need to publish artifacts to the maven repository first.

### Build Stack
From the `$KNOTX/knotx-aggregator/development` directory run:

```bash
./build-stack.sh -r ../../
```
The `-r` option points to the directory where all Knot.x repositories were cloned (which is `$KNOTX`).
Check `-h` option for help. 

The `build-stack.sh` command deploys the [Knot.x BOM file](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-dependencies) 
(Bill Of Materials) to the local Maven repository first. The BOM file specifies external dependencies, such as used Vert.x 
version etc. Then all modules are rebuilt. After the execution, please refresh your IDE.

### Build Docker Image
Now, when you have [Knot.x Stack](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-stack) built and deployed to your local M2 repo,
you may build a base docker image.
Navigate to `$KNOTX/knotx-docker` and run:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

After a successful build, you should have `knotx/knotx:X.X.X-SNAPSHOT` image in your local Docker images repository.
Check it running `docker images knotx/knotx` (note `X.X.X-SNAPSHOT` should correspond to the current SNAPSHOT version of Knot.x Stack).

### Build Starter-Kit
There are 2 distributions that `Knot.x Starter-Kit` builds:
- `ZIP`,
- `Docker image`.
You can find more details in the [Starter Kit repository README](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit).
After [cloning all Knot.x repositories](#clone-all-knotx-repositories) you can find Starter Kit in the
`$KNOTX/knotx-starter-kit`. Navigate to this repository now and follow the instructions from the 
[Starter Kit repository README](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit) to build desired distributions.

> Note that you need to build [Docker Image](#build-docker-image) if you want to use Docker image distribution.
> Otherwise, building [Stack](#build-stack) is sufficient.

## Run Knot.x instance using Knot.x Stack
There is a detailed tutorial on how to run Knot.x instance using the Stack:
- http://knotx.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-knotx-stack
That base on the released Knot.x version. If you [have built the Stack](#build-stack) you may use the `SNAPSHOT` version instead.

## Use cases
> Note: after cloning the repository please make sure all bash files have proper permissions.
> If not, please run:

```
$>git clone git@github.com:Knotx/knotx-aggregator.git
$>chmod -R 755 knotx-aggregator/**/*.sh
```

### Checkout and build all repositories for a specific branch
> This option is useful if you are working on a cross-repository feature

From `knotx-aggregator/development` run:
```
$>./pull-all.sh -r ../../ -b feature/my-changes -m origin/master
$>./build-stack.sh -r projects/knotx
```

### Deploy all to Maven Central SNAPSHOT repository
From `knotx-aggregator/development` run:
```
$>./pull-all.sh -r ../../ -b master -f
$>./build-stack.sh -r projects/knotx -d
```

> Note: `-f` flag will force-remove all changes in all Knot.x repositories. Make sure you don't have uncommitted changes.

# Release process
This section describes release process.

## Prerequisites
1. Sonatype.org [JIRA](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa) account

2. Your Sonatype.org account needs to be added to the Knot.x project (if it isn't, please contact the Knot.x team
via [User Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knotx) or [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/Knotx/Lobby).

3. A GPG key generated for the email you have registered on the Sonatype.org JIRA
(Follow the [Working with PGP Signatures](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html)
guide to get one).
**Don't forget to deploy your public key to the key server!**

4. Add a `<server>` entry to [your `settings.xml` file](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Introduction)
   ```xml
   <servers>
     ...
     <server>
       <id>ossrh</id>
       <username>your_sonatype_org_jira_username</username>
       <password>your_sonatype_org_jira_password</password>
     </server>
       ...
   </servers>    
   ```

5. Assuming you have created account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and you're assigned to the Knot.x organization, add server entry to your `settings.xml` to enable pushing to the docker registry.
```xml
	<server>
		<id>registry.hub.docker.com</id>
		<username>[Username]</username>
		<password>[password]</password>
	</server>
```

6. Bintray account created (to release Knot.x binary distributions) and token generated.

7. Update your `gradle.properties` with
```
signing.keyId=24875D73
signing.password=secret
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/Users/me/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```
and
```
ossrhUsername=your_sonatype_org_jira_username
ossrhPassword=your_sonatype_org_jira_password
```
For releasing gradle repos.
Also add
```
org.gradle.internal.http.connectionTimeout=60000
org.gradle.internal.http.socketTimeout=300000
```
To fix the read timeouts gradle issue.

## Procedure
> Prerequisites
> Install [Mac OSX/Gsed](http://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Mac_OSX/Gsed)

From the repository `release` directory execute following commands:

1. Clone repos. (It will do a shallow clone of all repos being a subject of the release procedure)
```bash
./clone.sh
```

2. Start release & provide the release version number
```bash
./start-release.sh 2.0.0
```

3. Validate release on staging repos

4. Release docker image:
```bash
./release-docker.sh
```

5. Close the release
Create manually new versions for `examples` and `distro` packages at bintray.
Run:
```bash
./close-release.sh 1.5.0 1.5.1-SNAPSHOT <bintrayUser> <bintrayToken>
```

6. Manual actions:
  - close and promote repos released by gradle manually at oss.sonatype.org
  - publish bintray files
  - update website - binary distro links
  - update wiki
  - publish release blog

## ToDo
- automatically close and promote repos released by gradle manually at oss.sonatype.org
- update `knotx-website`
  - binary distro links
  - `index` version
  - produce `blog/release-VERSION/` page that consists of all `CHANGELOG.md` changes for every module
  - deploy `SNAPSHOT` versions after release to make development of new versions possible and satisfy failing travis
